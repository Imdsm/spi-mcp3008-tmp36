spi-mcp3008-tmp36
=================

This is a Node.js solution for using SPI with MCP3008 ADC chip &amp; TMP36 analogue temp sensor.

You are required to have an SPI-able machine, such as a Raspberry Pi. For this test, I have two TMP36 chips wired up to feed data into CH0 and CH1 of a MCP3008 ADC chip.

Please see src/index.js for an explanation of the logic.
